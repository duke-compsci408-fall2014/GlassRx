GlassRx is focused on making it easy for patients and physicians to manage medications and their corresponding schedules. Managing pill dosages and schedules can become very difficult, as age and number of prescriptions increases, and the main goal of GlassRx is to simplify this process using Google Glass. First and foremost, GlassRx is a medication management application. As such, it will focus on maintaining the user’s (potentially complex) medication schedule. This will be accomplished through implementation of medication schedule creation/modification, alerts and alarms which notify the user when he/she must take a medication, connecting a Google user account to our database, and barcode scanning of medication bottles, time permitting. Because Glass applications are voice­ and gesture­ driven, GlassRx will allow for both voice acknowledgment of medication alerts and voice and gesture navigation through views. A similar application will also be implemented for a doctor to manage his or her patients’ pill schedules, adding or modifying a prescription for them, and seeing potential conflicts, all while maintaining face to face contact with the patient. Since controls and gestures can be cumbersome on the Glass device, and voice recognition of complicated pill names is a potential problem, our focus for the glass app will be on the display of schedules and the notifications, instead of the editing and creation of schedules. The phone app will be capable of editing schedules and adding medications, as well as providing additional notifications for the patients.

Currently one of our main dependencies is our one Google Glass. Because there is no real emulator for Glass available, we can’t really test and write code effectively without more Glass platforms to work on. We also depend on Glass's ability to safely transmit client­patient information. Currently, this is not the case, but we are writing it assuming that one day Glass will be able to securely store and transmit data.A large dependency in the long run will be the Google Glass itself. Right now, information cannot be transferred safely and securely. So in order for this to actually be useful, we’re depending on that to change. But it’s mutually agreed that we will just use fake patients for now, and hopefully at a later point we will be able to use this with actual patients and pills.
